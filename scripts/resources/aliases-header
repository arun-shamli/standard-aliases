# This file gets automatically generated every time new Bash
# shell is started, if either standard_functions (located in
# projects root) or users configuration file ~/.standardrc have
# changed.
# It contains functions with short names that call functions
# located in standard_functions, as defined in configuration
# file. It also assigns appropriate command-line completions to
# the short functions and exports variables that contain command
# options.
